    <h2>Lippan Kaam – The Mud and Mirror Magic of Kutch</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Lippan Kaam</b>, also known as <i>mud and mirror work</i>, is a traditional mural art from the <b>Rann of Kutch</b>, Gujarat. The word “Lippan” means “to smear,” and artisans use a mix of clay, camel dung, and mirrors to create glittering designs that reflect desert light. It decorates the walls of circular mud huts called <i>Bhungas</i>, making them shine like jewels under the sun.</p>
      <p>Originally practiced by the <b>Kumbhar</b> and <b>Rabari</b> communities, this art form connects deeply to their daily lives, beliefs, and environment. Its motifs — camels, peacocks, flowers, trees, and geometric shapes — mirror the beauty of desert life and its traditions.</p>
      <p>Today, Lippan Kaam has moved from rural homes to modern galleries and interior designs, showing how Indian heritage can blend beautifully with contemporary art.</p>

    <h2>Tholu Bommalata – The Dance of Shadows</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Tholu Bommalata</b> (meaning “leather puppet dance”) is a magnificent <b>shadow puppet theatre</b> from <b>Andhra Pradesh</b>. The puppets are made from translucent leather and colored with natural dyes, brought to life on a screen lit by oil lamps. As they dance and move, their shadows tell stories from the <b>Ramayana</b> and <b>Mahabharata</b>.</p>
      <p>This art form is centuries old — once performed in temple courtyards during festivals, combining music, dance, and storytelling. The artists, called <i>Tholu Bommalata performers</i>, craft each puppet by hand and narrate stories through song and rhythm. Sadly, with modern entertainment taking over, this tradition faces extinction.</p>
      <p>Preserving Tholu Bommalata means keeping alive not just a craft, but a storytelling culture that has inspired generations across South India.</p>

  <p>Exploring the beauty, heritage & future of <b>Lippan Kaam</b> and <b>Tholu Bommalata</b></p>
</header>

<section class="fade-in">
  <h2>🪞 Lippan Kaam – Mud & Mirror Work of Kutch</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p><b>Lippan Kaam</b> is a stunning mural art form from the Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. The word “Lippan” means “to smear” — and artisans smear their mud walls with clay, camel dung, and tiny mirrors called <i>aabhla</i> to create kaleidoscopic patterns that shimmer under desert sun and starlit nights. Homes called <i>Bhungas</i> glow like jewels, reflecting life in harmony with nature.</p>
    <p>Historically practiced by the <b>Kumbhar</b> (potter) and <b>Rabari</b> (pastoral) communities, this art encapsulates their faith, lifestyle, and relationship with the land. Symbols of camels, peacocks, lotus flowers, and geometric designs form stories, blessings, and identity.</p>
    <p>With modernization, fewer artisans continue Lippan Kaam — factory décor and synthetic materials have replaced handmade beauty. Yet today, this craft finds new life through interior design, gallery exhibitions, and heritage tourism, proving that tradition and contemporary living can shine together.</p>
    <h3>‍🔧 Materials & Technique</h3>
    <p>Artisans mix mud, camel dung, husk, lime and natural adhesives to prepare the base layer. Then they apply patterns using hand motifs, and insert small mirror-pieces. Once dry, the surface gleams beautifully under daylight or lamp light.</p>
    <h3>🎨 Cultural & Symbolic Significance</h3>
    <p>The mirrors capture sunlight — not just as light, but as protection, prosperity and community spirit. Decorating homes became a way to show hospitality and pride. The craft represents continuity, belonging, and creative resilience.</p>

  <h2>🎭 Tholu Bommalata – The Dance of Shadows</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p><b>Tholu Bommalata</b> translates to “leather puppet dance” and belongs to the cultural heart of Andhra Pradesh. Artists craft translucent leather puppets, paint with vegetable dyes, and perform behind a cloth screen lit by oil lamps. The puppets saddle the stages of myth — from the <b>Ramayana</b> to the <b>Mahabharata</b> — weaving drama, devotion, and laughter.</p>
    <p>For centuries, these storytellers carried their screen and puppets across villages at dusk. The beating of drums, the singing of epics, and the moving shadows created communal magic. Today, this tradition confronts cinema and digital distractions, yet retains a compelling power.</p>
    <h3>‍🔧 Materials & Technique</h3>
    <p>Puppets are cut from goat or deer leather, processed for translucence, painted in vivid hues (crimson, emerald, gold). Jointed with thread and rod, each figure moves elegantly behind a screen. The lamp’s light kisses the leather and casts heroic silhouettes.</p>
    <h3>🎭 Cultural & Symbolic Significance</h3>
    <p>Good versus evil, light versus shadow — Tholu Bommalata visualises life’s drama. It teaches values, connects communities, and respects traditional storytelling. Reviving it keeps ancient cinema alive in modern times.</p>
